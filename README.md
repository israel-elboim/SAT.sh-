üõ°Ô∏è Security Audit Tool (SAT) - Plus Edition
This is a comprehensive Bash script for performing security audits and analysis on Linux systems, with a specific focus on the Kali Linux distribution. It is designed to help users assess the security posture of their system and identify potential vulnerabilities.

Key Features
Comprehensive Checks: Audits SSH configurations, analyzes Cron jobs, checks kernel hardening measures, and examines Docker security.

Customizable: Includes different scan modes (full, SSH-only, network-only) to suit your needs.

Kali-Aware: Runs additional checks specific to Kali Linux systems, such as repository analysis, system health checks, and OpenVPN file identification.

Report Generation: Generates detailed reports in text, JSON, and HTML formats for easy review and analysis.

Security Scoring: Provides a weighted security score based on the findings.
